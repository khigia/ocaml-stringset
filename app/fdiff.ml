(*
Diff files:
- for line mode:
  - may apply transfo on line: s/\s+/ /g
  - using stringset, tag each line to an int identifier; align those int
  - display result might want to perform align of the line for replace edition
- word mode
- for char mode, we may still want to perform some transfo (ignore newline ...)
- for byte mode, no transfo?
- skip head while ident (possible to skip common tail?)
- for big file, may need to create non-optimal alignment from succession of local align (every 100 line or 100 bytes)
